# Sorting Exercise
# This is a project for the Hanze University.
For this exercise we studied several sorting algorithms and determined the Big O(order) of these algorithms.  
To make a better representation of the sorting algorithms we implemented an interface with three tabs: BubbleSort, QuickSort and InsertionSort.
We made or own implementations of the sorting algorithms with the ability to go one step further in the algrorithm instead of sorting the list completely. 
Because of this ability we can present the sorting algorithms in steps and get the ability to see what happens in the algorithm itself.
